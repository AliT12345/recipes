You need to take two toasts.  You spread peanut butter on one slice of one toast and (strawberry!) jelly on one side of the other toast.  Then you place the toasts on top of each other so that the sides with the spread on them face each other.  You then have to cut the toast in half, diagonally. DONE! EAT!
